# The wicked witch has captured the prince and imprisoned him in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon! 
# The dungeon consists of m Ã— n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. 
# The knight is initially positioned in the top-left room of the dungeon, 
# and she must fight her way through the dungeon to rescue the prince. 
# The knight has an initial health level represented by a positive integer. 
# If at any point her health level drops to 0 or below, she dies immediately.

# Some of the rooms in the dungeon are guarded by goblins, and the knight loses health upon entering these rooms. 
# These rooms are represented by cells that contain negative integers. 
# Other rooms are either empty, represented by cells that contain 0s, 
# or they contain magic potions that increase the knight's health, 
# represented by cells that contain positive integers. 
# In order to reach the prince as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only right or down for each step.

# Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that she is able to rescue the prince.
